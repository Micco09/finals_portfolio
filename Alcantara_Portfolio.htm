		<div class="cp">
        <p>Hi, my name is Micco Dominic D. Alcantara, 1st year BS Computer Science student. As a first year, I don't really have much experience with coding and programming aside from the skills I've acquired from my strand last year.</p>
        <p>My interest in programming started during my junior high school years with the introduction of HTML. I found it enjoyable and considered making it a career of mine. Fast forward 5 years, I got burnt out pursuing animation and art and decided to take this course to eventually pursue game development and also web design.</p>
